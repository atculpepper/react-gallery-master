# React Gallery

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## Description

This project was to spin up a full stack gallery app using React. Gallery data is stored in a server side array. Images are rendered to the UI, where users can interact by clicking a "Love it!" button. This button updates the "like" key within the key value, which is then displayed on the screen.

One of the project requirements asks that when a user clicks on a photo, a description is rendered to the to the page in place of the image. This condition is still a work in progress!
